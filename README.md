SDSSoundEncrypt
===============

Application of nonlinear stochastic differential systems for audio files encryption (proof of concept)

The essence of the approach is following: input audio signal is used as a parameter of nonlinear stochastic differential equation system (SDS) and the corresponding output signal of the SDS is used instead as encrypted value. The original audio signal is restored in reverse order.
